                <p> & welcome to my corner of the internet.
                    My name is Molly. I'm a product designer by trade and a maker at heart.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    With experience across numerous enterprise teams over the last 7 years, I specialize in complex technical domains spanning relational databases, virtual infrastructure, and developer tooling.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    My favorite projects are the ones where I get to work with thoughtful people who care deeply about quality. If you are the same, perhaps we'll collaborate sometime.
                    <br></br>
