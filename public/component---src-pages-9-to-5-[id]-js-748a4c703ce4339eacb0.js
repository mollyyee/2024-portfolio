When Airtable first started off, the homescreen didn’t need to hold a lot. Most users were working in one or two “bases” (an Airtable file for data, if you will.) But then we started supporting larger teams. And we saw these teams create upwards of 90 bases. We were also adding more objects to the Airtable universe. We launched “interfaces”, the user-built layer that would sit on top of a complex data in a “base.” We launched “organizations”, which represented a company. As we launched, we’d tack these new objects onto the homescreen in placeholder spots. We said we’d fix the outdated architecture of the homescreen someday. That day was this project. Because enterprise customers found it difficult to organize work and onboard their teams onto Airtable, we finally made the investment to redesign our homescreen. ",contributionText:"As part of the process, we had roughly 2 months to define the scope and 3 months to build it for a September launch of our high visibility design direction. A lot of my role initially was storytelling. To put together weekly executive checkins to quickly present directional forks in the road and get executive alignment on what we wanted the scope of this redesign to be.

We built a scoring system for all company APIs to benchmark how teams were doing. I designed a leaderboard to display API quality scores across our 100 products.

While teams were getting the visibility they needed into their API health and taking action to fix issues, we also wanted to continue adding more useful data to our analytics platform. We want to include Google Analytics information and telemetry data to give product teams a sense of usage. This way we can add a layer of criticality on top of our data and begin prioritizing APIs by how frequently customers use them.",conclusionLearnings2:"The validity of our data was crucial for initial adoption of our tooling. However, grading APIs meant there was naturally some subjectivity around what our team considered good APIs. As we abstracted API quality into a single grade, we ran into issues where using the American grading system (A through F grading) fell short. VMware was a global company with developers all over the world. My teammate in Bulgaria pointed out that in Bulgaria, 6 was the highest and 2 was the lowest where 6 is excellent.
