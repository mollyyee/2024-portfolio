But then we started supporting larger teams. And we saw these teams create upwards of 90 bases. We were also adding more objects to the Airtable universe. We launched “interfaces”, the user-built layer that would sit on top of a complex data in a “base.” We launched “organizations”, which represented a company. As we launched, we’d tack these new objects onto the homescreen in placeholder spots. We said we’d fix the outdated architecture of the homescreen someday. That day was this project. Because enterprise customers found it difficult to organize work and onboard their teams onto Airtable, we finally made the investment to redesign our homescreen. \",\n    contributionText: \"As part of the process, we had roughly 2 months to define the scope and 3 months to build it for a September launch of our high visibility design direction.
